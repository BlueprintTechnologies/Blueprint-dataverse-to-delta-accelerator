# Blueprint Dataverse-to-Delta Accelerator
Microsoft Dataverse is a set of data services, tables/schemas and security features that support Dynamics 365 and PowerApps.

## Overview
While there are several integration platforms that perform the task of integrating data from Dataverse to Databricks quite brilliantly (E.g. FiveTran) and whoâ€™s approach may offer significant advantages to the following pattern; We built a native Databricks process to showcase a pattern that can be used for not only Dataverse, but any REST ODATA endpoint.

The included notebook is completely dynamic, including the schema inference. It results in a Delta table, ready for analysis.
